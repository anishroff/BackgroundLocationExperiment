# Background Location Experiment

## Purpose

Play around with location services such that 
- A) we can record location updates (with a throttled frequency), and 
- B) send the location updates to a web service, 
- C) _all while continuing to work while the app is in the background_ 
(though, less ideally, if persisting the locations works in the background, we could push them up later).
